# Accident_Notification
This app is used to reduce the rescue time if an accident occurs.
If the app detects the occurence of an accident, it notifies if the driver is safe with a sound.
If yes button is clicked, it goes back to normal state.
If the no button is clicked or nothing is clicked for 50 seconds, a message will be sent to a pre set number.
The message includes the current location of the accident.
